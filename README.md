Dark shipping = when the pairing involves dark, problematic, or morally questionable elements.

## INT
Proshippers, it is an ideological stance within fandom that defends the freedom to create and consume any fictional ship, and opposes harassment against people for their fictional preference, dont be stupid on mistaking it for darkshipping

basically everyone except the ones on dni
